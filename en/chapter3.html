            <p>Early neural network researchers in the 1950s took inspirations from a neuron, the
                building block of brains, to create an algorithm called the perceptron.
            </p>
            <p>To understand what a perceptron is, let’s first take a look at a neuron.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="nerveText" class="bg-1grey scene">
        <div class="text right">
            <p>A neuron is composed of 3 main parts:</p>
            <p>Dendrites: Receivers of neural information that takes in stimuli from other neurons.</p>
            <p>Soma: The “core” of a neuron where the nucleus is located; it decides if a signal
                will be sent to other neurons.</p>
            <p>Axon: Long extending neck of the neuron that passes any signal to any of the
                neighbor neurons.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="neuron1Text" class="scene bg-2grey upperLayer">
        <div class="text left">
            <p>The perceptron, similarly, also has 3 major parts:</p>
            <p>Inputs: inputs take in signals in the form of numbers and pass them to the
                perceptron.</p>
            <p>Perceptron: the perceptron takes in the inputs and conducts some calculations on
                them.</p>
            <p>
                Output: the output of the perceptron spits out the result of the calculations.
            </p>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="neuron2Text" class="scene bg-2grey upperLayer">
        <div class="text left">
            <p>Between inputs and perceptrons, the axon-to-dendrite connection is simplified to an
                edge, and signals transmitted are represented with numbers.<br>
                The input on top here is connected to the perceptron with a thicker edge, thus the
                signal is amplified, in this case by a factor of 2, when it reaches the neuron.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="neuron3Text" class="scene bg-2grey upperLayer">
        <div class="text left">
            <p>However, the input at the bottom has a thinner connection to the neuron, in this
                case reducing the signal to two thirds of what it was. The perceptron then sums the
                received signals: 2 from the top and 2 from the bottom, resulting in a final signal
                of 4.
                <br>
                The thickness of the edge is called <strong class="highlight" data-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="A numeric value associated with an edge. It can amplify, reduce, or invert signals.">weight</strong>.

    </div>

    <div id="neuron4Text" class="scene bg-2grey upperLayer">
        <div class="text left">
            <p>Next, the perceptron processes the signal by "shaking" itself. In this case, doing so
                increased the signal by 1.
                <br>
                The “shakiness” of a perceptron is called <strong class="highlight" data-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="A numeric value added onto the weighted sum of all input signals.">bias</strong>,
                which can either increase or decrease the value of the signal by any set amount.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="neuron5Text" class="scene bg-2grey upperLayer">
        <div class="text left">
            <p>Finally, an <strong class="highlight" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A function that is used to control the final output of a perceptron.">
                    activation function</strong> is used to decide how strong a signal the
                perceptron should transmit to its neighbors. More on this issue soon!
            </p>
            <p>
                The sigmoid function, a type of activation functions, is used here. It maps the
                signal value into the range of 0-1. In our case, 5 is being mapped to 0.99, which
                becomes the final output.

            <p>
                Early researchers tried to use these perceptrons to determine how likely an image
                contains a human face, but they quickly ran into a problem: the
                resulting probability of the model was often above 100% or below 0%.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="appanana2Text" class="scene topLayer bg-3grey">
        <div class="text right">
            <p>
                To tackle this problem, the researchers put an activation function behind the
                output of the perceptron, which could control the output range of that perceptron.
                The sigmoid function and ReLU are examples of activation functions that are
                commonly used to achieve different output ranges.
            </p>

        <div class="text right">
            <p>
                Sigmoid calculates the probability that something is true. For example, if you
                want to determine if an image is a cat or not, you would use a sigmoid activation
                function, which transforms the output value into a probability (a number between 0
                and 1).

        <div class="text right">
            <p>
                ReLU makes sure that the final output is non-negative, and is commonly used in
                multilayer networks. Unlike sigmoid whose main purpose is to limit output range,
                ReLU is used to break linearity so that the multilayer networks can learn more
                complex concepts. We will talk about this notion in depth in Chapter 5.

                            other more complex neural networks.
